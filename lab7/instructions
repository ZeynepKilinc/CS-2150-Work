addition.ibcm
Write a single IBCM program that does the following:

Gets three values from user input
Stores the values into three variables
Adds the variables together, and prints the sum (you may use additional memory if you wish)
If the sum is zero, it prints the three values and stops
If the sum is not zero, it starts over (tries to get three values, etc.)


array.ibcm
Write a second IBCM program that finds the maximum value in an array of values.

The array base address is hard-coded into memory – meaning it’s a pre-set value, and this is not obtained by user input. You can have the array be all or part of the IBCM program, or a section of memory after the program with values that you have selected.
You may also hard code other values, such as the number of elements in the array, into your program
Before your program halts, it prints out the maximum value of the array
